# Advent of Code 2023

## Summary
This is my code for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2023, I am doing the challenges in the Go programming language.

## Days
|Day|Name|Stars|
|---|----|-----|
|01|Trebuchet?!|⭐⭐|
|02|Cube Conundrum|⭐⭐|

## Running my solutions
With Go installed (I use 1.21.4, no guarantees all code will work on other versions) you can run the following command in the main directory of this project
```
go run main.go
```
This will, by default, spit out both solutions for any day I have done.

With the `-d` flag you can specify a day (without leading 0) and with `-p` you can specify a part


## Thoughts file
After each puzzle I'm putting my thoughts on it in `thoughts.md`
